# CNN-Framework
Convolutional Neural Network with custom matrix implementations for AP Research project.

The goal of this framework is to be able to reuse it for future projects I come up with. Additionally, 
I need to document the programs I use for my research in this class. 

# Sources
I should have saved and then linked the source I used for creating the determinate method.
I think I just used a common website like geeks4geeks or something when looking up the 
process for taking the inverse of a matrix.

# Notes or things to be noted
  1. There is going to be no user friendly GUI
  2. A test program will have to be created using the .hpp files 
  3. Loading of datasets will have to be manually done
